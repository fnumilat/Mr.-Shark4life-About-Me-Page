        Mr.Shark4life is a decision. The world is full of fish. You can go through life being a gubbie or you can choose to be a shark. It’s up to you. Mr. Shark can be you or can be anyone ready to take action and move forward from their situation. Someone who won’t let their past dictate where their going. Someone who puts the past behind them and focuses on a brighter future. 
        <br><br>
        Sharks are fascinating creatures, they can’t swim backwards or they die. They must continue swimming forward to survive. It’s life or death for a shark so why not choose life. Choose to live your life to the fullest. Choose to let your past die so you can live. Mr.Shark, or LadyShark is someone that knows that mistakes empower them. 
        <br><br>
        My real name is Daniel Vega, being called Shark started when I was 12 years old. A good friend of mine gave me the name because he said I looked like one. What I didn't know was it would stay with me my whole life, even when I didn't want the name anymore. People would remind me of who I am and where I came from. I come from humble beginnings. In a rough neighborhood in New York City.
        <br><br>
        To be honest I was no fighter. My Mom bless her heart. She tried to protect me from everything. But growing up in that environment still made me a stronger person. It wasn't until waves of change happen in my life as an adult that Mr. Shark was born. 
        <br><br>
        We grow up and life happens to all of us. Maybe not at the same time but, at some point you will go through some things in your life, that will feel like you are drowning in what you going through. But it’s not what happens to us, but how we react to our situations that will truly reveal who we are to the world.
        <br><br>
        Most people tend to float through life. They get caught up in their day to day lives and lose sight of who they are. They don’t know how to fight for what they want. Mostly because their to busy fighting to keep what they already have. What are you holding on to? If you keep fighting for what you only have, you will never get or make room what you truly want. 
        <br><br>
        Mr.Shark is a brand created to empower people to look straight ahead in life. To aggressively focus on their desired outcome and use their past as the fuel to keep moving forward. Working out, eating right, moving forward towards a healthy better lifestyle requires a decision that starts in the mind. If you don’t have your mind right and you don’t have your body right. How can you ever get your life right?  Who do you want to be? The world belongs to the bold, so choose to be a shark. 
        <br><br>
        Who am I? My name is Mr. Shark4life. Decision made. Here to serve and improve the lives I encounter and this will truly be my measure. Let’s all rise up so we can serve and improve the lives we encounter together.
