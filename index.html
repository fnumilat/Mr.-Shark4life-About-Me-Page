        Mr. Shark4life is a decision. The world is full of fish. You can go through life being a guppie or you can choose to be a shark. It’s up to you. 
        <br><br>
        Mr. Shark can be you or can be anyone ready to take action and move forward from their situation. Someone who won’t let their past dictate where their going. Someone who will put their past behind them and focus on a brighter future.
        <br><br>
        Sharks are fascinating creatures, they can’t swim backwards or they die. They must continue swimming forward to survive. It’s life or death for a shark so why not choose life. Choose to live your life to the fullest. Choose to let your past die so you can live. Mr. Shark or LadyShark is someone that knows that mistakes empower them.
        <br><br>
        My real name is Daniel Vega, being called a Shark started when I was very young. A good friend of mine gave me the name because he said I looked like one. What I didn't know was it would stay with me my whole life, even when I didn't want the name anymore. People would remind me of who I am and where I came from. 
        <br><br>
        I come from humble beginnings. In a rough neighborhood in the Lower East Side of New York City. I was no fighter. I learned to pick my battles and avoided confrontation as much as possible. But growing up there still made me a stronger person. It wasn't until waves of change happen in my life as an adult that Mr. Shark was born.
        <br><br>
        We grow up and life tends to happen to all of us. Maybe not all at the same time but, at some point you will go through some things in your life that will feel like you are drowning in what your going through. But it’s not what happens to us, but how we react to our situations that will truly reveal who we are to the world. 
        <br><br>
        Sharks never sleep. They float or they drift in a trance like state and just like sharks, most people are just floating through life. They get caught up in their day to day lives and lose sight of who they are. They don’t know how to fight for what they want. Mostly because their to busy fighting to keep what they already have. What are you holding on to? If you keep fighting for what you only have, you will never get or make room for what you truly want. I believe everyone has a shark inside them waiting to come out. 
        <br><br>
        Mr. Shark or Lady Shark is a brand created to empower people to look straight ahead in life. To aggressively focus on their desired outcome and use their past as fuel to keep moving forward. 
        <br><br>
        Exercising, eating right or moving on from trials and tribulations in life requires a decision that starts in the mind. If you don’t have your mental state in the correct frame of mind and you don’t have your body in the correct size and shape. How can you expect your life to have the correct form and posture? Your life must be in line with who you are or who you want to be. The world belongs to the bold, so choose to be a shark.
        <br><br>
        My mission is to serve and improve the lives I encounter and this will truly be my measure. Let’s all rise up and serve and improve the lives we encounter together.
        <br><br>
        Always Forward Never Backwards
        <br><br>
        My name is Mr. Shark4life.
        <br><br>
        Decision made.
